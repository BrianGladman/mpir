This directory contains new project and solution generator
for all Visual Studio versions.

Improvements:
1) One generator for all MSVS versions.
2) Removed per-file <ClCompile><ObjectFileName>. Vcxproj became much shorter.
3) Set <UseDebugLibraries>. Microsoft system property sheets will work better. 
4) Support external property sheet: user may embed his own props file via command line.
5) Impoved indents in projects and filters files.

And also some errors fixed:
1) Removed <YASM><ObjectFileName> - it no longer used
2) Error in file searching directory (for msvc 10 and 11)
3) Error in <YASM><IncludePaths> for Win32 platform
4) Error with GUID in Msvc14 solution.
5) Error in <ClCompile><PreprocessorDefinitions> for exe-projects

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embedding external property sheet.

User may define property MPIR_Props_External
(for example, in MSBUILD command line) to pass a name of his own property sheet,
that will be imported after all others property sheets.
This is a way to customize project building, without editing downloaded MPIR files.

Example:
msbuild.exe /P:MPIR_Props_External=d:\MyWork\MyProps.props mpir\build.vc11\dll_mpir_gc\dll_mpir_gc.vcxproj

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpir_config.py - MSVC project and solution generator.

Using:
  python mpir_config.py NN

where NN is Visual C version: 10, 11, 12, 14 (12 by default).

For example: 
  python mpir_config.py 14 

    will generates projects and solution for VisualStudio 2015 (Msvc14)

Projects and solutions will be put to build.vcNN directory (directory must exist)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vsyasm.* files

Required for project files. They are the same in all build.vcNN, so it would be
better to have them only in this directory.

Projects generated by build.vc\mpir_config.py use build.vc\vsyasm.* files. So these files
may be removed from build.vcNN directories
