This directory contains new project and solution generator
for all Visual Studio versions.

Improvements:
1) One generator for all MSVS versions.
2) Removed per-file <ClCompile><ObjectFileName>. Vcxproj became much shorter.
3) Set <UseDebugLibraries>. Microsoft system property sheets will work better. 
4) Support external property sheet: user may embed his own props file via command line.
5) Impoved indents in projects and filters files.

And also some errors fixed:
1) Removed <YASM><ObjectFileName> - it no longer used
2) Error in file searching directory (for msvc 10 and 11)
3) Error in <YASM><IncludePaths> for Win32 platform
4) Error with GUID in Msvc14 solution.
5) Error in <ClCompile><PreprocessorDefinitions> for exe-projects

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embedding external property sheet.

User may create his own property sheet that will change some project settings.
To embed this property sheet into building process one need to define property
MPIR_Props_External (for example, in MSBUILD command line). MPIR_Props_External should
contain path to this property sheet file. Path must be absolute or relative to vcxproj.
This property sheet will be imported by vcxproj after all others property sheets.
So, this is a way to customize project building, without editing downloaded MPIR files.

Example:
msbuild.exe /P:MPIR_Props_External=d:\MyWork\MyProps.props mpir\build.vc11\dll_mpir_gc\dll_mpir_gc.vcxproj

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpir_config.py - MSVC project and solution generator.

Using:
  python mpir_config.py NN

where NN is Visual C version: 10, 11, 12, 14 (12 by default).

For example: 
  python mpir_config.py 14 

    will generates projects and solution for VisualStudio 2015 (Msvc14)

Projects and solutions will be put to build.vcNN directory (directory must exist)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vsyasm.* files

Required for project files. They are the same in all build.vcNN, so it would be
better to have them only in this directory.

Projects generated by build.vc\mpir_config.py use build.vc\vsyasm.* files. So these files
may be removed from build.vcNN directories
